This is the repo containing my personal website source code.
It is inspired on <a href="https://jonbarron.info/"></a>Jon Barron's personal website</a> <a href="https://github.com/jonbarron/jonbarron_website">source code</a>.
Feel free to fork it and use it!
And if you find any typos or errors please let me know, I would really appreciate it.
The goal was to make a smooth minimalistic clean page (hopefully I somewhat got there).
